# About Me
* I am a 5th-year Ph.D. Candidate in the [Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://www.ise.vt.edu/) at [Virginia Tech](https://vt.edu/), advised by Prof. [Zhenyu (James) Kong](https://www.ise.vt.edu/people/faculty/kong.html). 
   * I am graduating in 2022 summer.
   * Some of my profiles are available: [[Curriculum Vitae](https://boshen0.github.io/files/BoCV.pdf)] [[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OO3dy4wAAAAJ&hl=en)] [[ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bo-Shen-22)].
* I received my B.S. of Statistics from [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/)  in 2017.

# Reseach Interest
 ***[Advanced manufacturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_manufacturing)*** grows rapidly in the era of Industrial 4.0. As a crucial component of advanced manufacturing systems, Additive Manufacturing (AM), also called 3D printing, promises a future of mass-producing highly personalized products at a competitive cost. The fast-growing sensor technology and simulation software provide a massive amount of data for AM processes. However, the information that can discovered from the data by our human directly is limited.  My reseach mainly focus on developing advanced machine learning methods to unreveal data information that is "underwater". I have successfully applied my methods to ensure the quality and reliability of products in **smart additive manufacturing**. I am currently interested in **Adversarial robustness**, **Bayesian optimization**, **Federated learning**, **Physics-informed machine learning**, **Reinforcement learning**, and **Tensor data analytics**, etc. I would like to keep working on my research at the interface of data science and advanced manufacturing. In near future, I will extend my research to **Cybersecurity** and **Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)**.
